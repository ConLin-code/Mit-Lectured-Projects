# Prompt the user to enter two numbers and an arithmetic operation (addition, subraction, multiplication, or division).
# Use function to perform each arithmetic operation seperately.
# Implement error handling to manage division by zero and invalid input types.
# Display the result of the chosen operation in a clear and formatted manner.
# Include a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.
# Use conditional statements to determine and execute the correct operation based on user input.
# Incorporate comments throughout the code to explain the logic and functionality of each section.
# Ensure that the programs handles both integer and floating-point arithmetic accurately. 
# Implement input validation to ensure the user enters valid number and operation choices.
# Emphasize code readability and organization, following best practices discussed in the lecture.
