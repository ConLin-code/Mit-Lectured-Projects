# Create a python program that simulates a simple grade book system using dictionaries. 
#Initialize a function to add a new student to store student information.
#Implement a function to add a new student to the grade book. It should take a student name and an initial grade as parameters
# Create a function to update a studnet's grade, taking the student name and new grade as parameters.
# Implement a function to remove a studnet from the grade book.
# Create a function to remove a student from the grade book
# Implement a function to display all students and their grades.
# Create a function to find and return the name(s) of the student(s) with the highest grade.
#Use a loop to allow the user to interact with the grade book system, providing options to add students, update grades, remove studnets, display all grades, show the average grade, and find the top student(s)
# Implement error handling for cases such as trying to update a grade for a non-existant student or removing a studnet who isn't in the grade book
# Use appropriate comments to explain your code, especially focusing on dictionary operations and any efficiency considerations.
