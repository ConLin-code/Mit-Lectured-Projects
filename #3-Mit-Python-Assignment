# Create a python program that generates and analyzes a simple number sequence.
# Prompt the user to enter a positive integer "N".
# Use a while loop to generate a sequence of number from 1 to N.
# Within the loop, use an if-else statement to determine if each number is even or odd.
# Keep a count of even and odd numbers encountered.
# Use a for loop to iterate through the generated sequence and find the sum of all numbers.
# Calculate and display the average of the sequence.
# Use a nested loop to find and display all pairs of numbers in the sequence that add up to "N".
# Implement error handling to ensure the user enteres a valid positive integer.
# Use appropriate comments to explain the code.
# Print a summary of the results, including the counts of even and odd numbers, the sum, average, and the pairs that add up to "N".
