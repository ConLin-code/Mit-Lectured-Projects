# Mit-Lectured-Projects
Over the course of this year, I have watched the YouTube course supported from MIT OpenCourseWare on python programming (MIT 6.100L Introduction to CS and Programming using Python, Fall 2022) and completed certain "assignments". My code was done a while back, I just thought i'd post it on github for anyone trying to do the same as I did -- learn python.

# What I did do to learn python?
I would watch the lecture that MIT provided online for free while taking notes-- mine specifically being handwritten. I then asked Chatgpt to give me some questions on that given lecture that someone would have had to watch to know, but not need any other knowledge outside of this lecture to understand. On average it provided me with 7 questions that I would answer based on the lecture afterwards, testing my knowledge even more. Is that it? No way. What I then did was ask Chatgpt to give me an problem/assignment that I would have to code by myself.

# What do you do if you don't know something
If you don't understand something in the lecture, Chatgpt or some sort of LLM is your best friend. Think of it as your teacher when your in school. Now, if you don't know how to do an assignment, I tried to avoid using the LLM to help me with coding, since I wouldn't be learning as much as grinding through it. But, if you are stuck on something for quite some time and have looked back in the lectures for help, which was not suffice, then I would recommend you to ask it questions that aid in helping your code, but not doing your code for you.

# How is each file structured?
Each file contains the assignment (which is commented on the top of each file) in which Chatgpt gave me to complete, and the python code that I wrote to do what was assigned.
