# Create a python programs that simulates a simple text-based game where the user navigates through a serious of choices.
# Begin by gretting the user and explaining the game rules.
# Use the input function to allow the user to make choices at each step of the game.
# Implement branching using conditional statements to determine the outcome of each choice.
# Include at least three different paths or endings based on the user's decisions.
# Use string concatenation and f-strings to create dynamic and engaging text outputs.
# Use comments to explain the logic and structure of the code.
# Emphasize code readability and organization, following best practices discussed in the lecture.
